# Lending Club Case Study

  ## Problem Statement
  	In a certain consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers receives loan application and it has to make a decision for loan approval based on applicant’s profile. 
	The bank has to deal with two type of risks associated to these applications 
   	A. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
        B. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

 ## Risk
	A. Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
	Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate).
	Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
	Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan.
        B. Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.).Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company 	         and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset).

 ## Objective
 	Use EDA to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk 		assesment
